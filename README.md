# Superstore SQL Project

This project uses SQL to explore and analyze a sample retail dataset ("Superstore") that includes product categories, pricing, stock, and ratings. All queries were written using PostgreSQL and tested on db-fiddle.com.

## What You'll Find

- Basic SELECT and ORDER BY queries
- Aggregations: SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, COUNT
- Filtering using WHERE and GROUP BY
- Real-world business questions and answers (e.g., total stock by category)

## Tools Used

- PostgreSQL (via db-fiddle)
- GitHub for version control and portfolio hosting
